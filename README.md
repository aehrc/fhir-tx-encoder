# FHIR Terminology Encoder

This is a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) compatible encoder that uses 
a FHIR terminology server to encode ontological features.

It currently supports subsumption relationships and properties.

You supply a scope in the form of a FHIR ValueSet URI, and a FHIR terminology
endpoint.

The result is a multi-hot encoded vector delivered as a sparse matrix, suitable
for input into most models and estimators.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fhir-tx-encoder
```

## Usage

```python
from fhir_tx import FhirTerminologyEncoder
import numpy as np

encoder = FhirTerminologyEncoder(
    # Ancestors of the SNOMED CT concept "Malignant neoplastic disease" (363346000)
    scope="http://snomed.info/sct?fhir_vs=ecl/(%3E%3E%20363346000)",
    # Include "Associated morphology" (116676008) as a property
    properties=["116676008"]
)

# Encode two SNOMED CT concepts:
# - "Neoplasm and/or hamartoma" (399981008)
# - "Malignant neoplastic disease" (363346000)
result = encoder.fit_transform(np.array([["399981008", "363346000"]]))

# Print out the result and its shape.
print(f"result.shape: {result.shape}")
print(f"result:\n{result.toarray()}")

# Print out the feature names.
print(f"encoder.feature_names_: {encoder.feature_names_}")
```

Which would output:
